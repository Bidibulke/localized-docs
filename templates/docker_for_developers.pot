msgid "This command should drop you into an interactive shell where you can run spack within an isolated docker container running ubuntu.  The copy of spack being used should be tied to the working copy of your cloned git repo, so any changes you make should be immediately reflected in the running docker container.  Feel free to add or modify any packages or to hack on spack, itself.  Your contained copy of spack should immediately reflect all changes."
