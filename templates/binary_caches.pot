msgid "Some sites may encourage users to set up their own test environments before carrying out central installations, or some users may prefer to set up these environments on their own motivation. To reduce the load of recompiling otherwise identical package specs in different installations, installed packages can be put into build cache tarballs, uploaded to your Spack mirror and then downloaded and installed by others."
