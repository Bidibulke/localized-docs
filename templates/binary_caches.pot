msgid "Some sites may encourage users to set up their own test environments before carrying out central installations, or some users may prefer to set up these environments on their own motivation. To reduce the load of recompiling otherwise identical package specs in different installations, installed packages can be put into build cache tarballs, uploaded to your Spack mirror and then downloaded and installed by others."

Compressed tarballs are signed with gpg and signature and tarball and put in a ``.spack`` file. Optionally, the rpaths (and ids and deps on macOS) can be changed to paths relative to the Spack install tree before the tarball is created."

However, many packages compile paths into binary artifacts directly. In such cases, the build instructions of this package would need to be adjusted for better re-locatability."
