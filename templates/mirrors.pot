msgid "Some sites may not have access to the internet for fetching packages. These sites will need a local repository of tarballs from which they can get their files.  Spack has support for this with *mirrors*.  A mirror is a URL that points to a directory, either on the local filesystem or on some server, containing tarballs for all of Spack's packages."
