"Spack is a package management tool designed to support multiple versions and "
"configurations of software on a wide variety of platforms and environments.  "
"It was designed for large supercomputing centers, where many users and "
"application teams share common installations of software on clusters with "
"exotic architectures, using libraries that do not have a standard ABI.  "
"Spack is non-destructive: installing a new version does not break existing "
"installations, so many configurations can coexist on the same system."
