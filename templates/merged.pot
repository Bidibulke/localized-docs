"dependencies. For example, ``libpciaccess`` is a dependency of openmpi and "
"requires ``m4`` to build. Spack will build ``m4`` as part of the "
"installation of ``openmpi``, but it does not become a part of the DAG "
"because it is not linked in at run time. Spack handles build dependencies "
"differently because of their different (less strict) consistency "
