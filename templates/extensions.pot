This might be extremely useful e.g. to develop and maintain a command whose purpose is too specific to be considered for reintegration into the mainline or to evolve a command through its early stages before starting a discussion to merge it upstream. From Spack's point of view an extension is any path in your filesystem which respects a prescribed naming and layout for files:"
