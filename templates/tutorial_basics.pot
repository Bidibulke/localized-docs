msgid "This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing software using Spack. We will first cover the `spack install` command, focusing on the power of the spec syntax and the flexibility it gives to users. We will also cover the `spack find` command for viewing installed packages and the `spack uninstall` command. Finally, we will touch on how Spack manages compilers, especially as it relates to using Spack-built compilers within Spack. We will include full output from all of the commands demonstrated, although we will frequently call attention to only small portions of that output (or merely to the fact that it succeeded). The provided output is all from an AWS instance running Ubuntu 16.04"

msgid "Spack can install software either from source or from a binary cache. Packages in the binary cache are signed with GPG for security. For the tutorial we have prepared a binary cache so you don't have to wait on slow compilation from source. To be able to install from the binary cache, we will need to configure Spack with the location of the binary cache and trust the GPG key that the binary cache was signed with."

msgid "The spec syntax also includes compiler flags. Spack accepts ``cppflags``, ``cflags``, ``cxxflags``, ``fflags``, ``ldflags``, and ``ldlibs`` parameters.  The values of these fields must be quoted on the command line if they include spaces. These values are injected into the compile line automatically by the Spack compiler wrappers."

#: ../spack/lib/spack/docs/tutorial_basics.rst:277
msgid "Spack generates a hash for each spec. This hash is a function of the full provenance of the package, so any change to the spec affects the hash. Spack uses this value to compare specs and to generate unique installation directories for every combinatorial version. As we move into more complicated packages with software dependencies, we can see that Spack reuses existing packages to satisfy a dependency only when the existing package's hash matches the desired spec."
msgstr ""

#: ../spack/lib/spack/docs/tutorial_basics.rst:303

msgid "Packages can also be referred to from the command line by their package hash. Using the ``spack find -lf`` command earlier we saw that the hash of our optimized installation of zlib (``cppflags=\"-O3\"``) began with ``64mns5m``. We can now explicitly build with that package without typing the entire spec, by using the ``/`` sigil to refer to it by hash. As with other tools like git, you do not need to specify an *entire* hash on the command line.  You can specify just enough digits to identify a hash uniquely.  If a hash prefix is ambiguous (i.e., two or more installed packages share the prefix) then spack will report an error."

msgid "Let's move on to slightly more complicated packages. ``HDF5`` is a good example of a more complicated package, with an MPI dependency. If we install it \"out of the box,\" it will build with ``openmpi``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Spack packages can also have build options, called variants. Boolean variants can be specified using the ``+`` and ``~`` or ``-`` sigils. There are two sigils for ``False`` to avoid conflicts with shell parsing in different situations. Variants (boolean or otherwise) can also be specified using the same syntax as compiler flags.  Here we can install HDF5 without MPI support."
msgstr ""

#: ../spack/lib/spack/docs/tutorial_basics.rst:650
msgid "We might also want to install HDF5 with a different MPI implementation. While MPI is not a package itself, packages can depend on abstract interfaces like MPI. Spack handles these through \"virtual dependencies.\" A package, such as HDF5, can depend on the MPI interface. Other packages (``openmpi``, ``mpich``, ``mvapich``, etc.) provide the MPI interface.  Any of these providers can be requested for an MPI dependency. For example, we can build HDF5 with MPI support provided by mpich by specifying a dependency on ``mpich``. Spack also supports versioning of virtual dependencies. A package can depend on the MPI interface at version 3, and provider packages specify what version of the interface *they* provide. The partial spec ``^mpi@3`` can be safisfied by any of several providers."

msgid "Spack models the dependencies of packages as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The ``spack find -d`` command shows the tree representation of that graph.  We can also use the ``spack graph`` command to view the entire DAG as a graph."
msgstr ""

#: ../spack/lib/spack/docs/tutorial_basics.rst:888
msgid "You may also have noticed that there are some packages shown in the ``spack find -d`` output that we didn't install explicitly. These are dependencies that were installed implicitly. A few packages installed implicitly are not shown as dependencies in the ``spack find -d`` output. These are build dependencies. For example, ``libpciaccess`` is a dependency of openmpi and requires ``m4`` to build. Spack will build ``m4`` as part of the installation of ``openmpi``, but it does not become a part of the DAG because it is not linked in at run time. Spack handles build dependencies differently because of their different (less strict) consistency requirements. It is entirely possible to have two packages using different versions of a dependency to build, which obviously cannot be done with linked dependencies."

msgid "Now we're starting to see the power of Spack. Trilinos in its default configuration has 23 top level dependecies, many of which have dependencies of their own. Installing more complex packages can take days or weeks even for an experienced user. Although we've done a binary installation for the tutorial, a source installation of trilinos using Spack takes about 3 hours (depending on the system), but only 20 seconds of programmer time."
