"Spack is a package management tool designed to support multiple versions and "
"configurations of software on a wide variety of platforms and environments.  "
"It was designed for large supercomputing centers, where many users and "
"application teams share common installations of software on clusters with "
"exotic architectures, using libraries that do not have a standard ABI.  "
"Spack is non-destructive: installing a new version does not break existing "
"installations, so many configurations can coexist on the same system."
msgstr ""
"Spackは様々なプラットフォームやシステム環境にインストールされているソフトウェアの複数のバージョン、"
"設定などを管理するために設計されています。Spackは、スーパーコンピュータシステムを運用するセンターなどでの"
"利用を想定して設計しています。大規模なセンターなどでは、多くのユーザやチームがシステムにインストールされている"
"ソフトウェアを利用したり、ソフトウェアを共有したりしていますが、それらは、様々のクラスタ上で標準的な"
"ABI(Application Binary Interface)を持たないライブラリを利用しています。Spackを利用することで、"
"新しいバージョンのソフトウェアをインストールしても既存の環境を破壊することなく、"
"同じシステム上に多数の構成を共存させることができます。"

"Most importantly, Spack is *simple*.  It offers a simple *spec* syntax so "
"that users can specify versions and configuration options concisely.  Spack "
"is also simple for package authors: package files are written in pure "
"Python, and specs allow package authors to maintain a single file for many "
"different builds of the same package."
msgstr ""
"Spackがシンプルであることは、最も重要な点です。Spackユーザは、シンプルな文法で"
"利用したいソフトウェアのバージョン、設定、オプション等を指定できます。また、Spackは、"
"パッケージングを行うユーザにとってもシンプルです。パッケージファイルは"
"純粋なPythonで記述されていて、多種多様なビルド方法を記載する場合でも、"
"更新するのは単一のファイルです。"
